### Regression complexity demo app
The RShiny application contained in the "regression_complexity_demo" directory allows you experiment with sample size, noise levels, and cross-validation (number of folds and number of repeats) at identifying the correct model out of a set of candidate models. Specifically, this demo app performs the polynomial regression example described in lecture.
